E-Z Stopwatch App

Created using VSCode.

This stopwatch app was made with ,help from a YouTube tutorial ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1INmsFnD-u4 )
and uses basic HTML, CSS and Javascript.

I started by making the base page for the app using HTML, which feature a plain page, with a "Start" and "Reset" button, and the numbers "00:00:00" as the starting value for the timer.

Next I used JavaScript to create the functions which makes the stopwatch start, stop and reset back to its default value (00:00:00). I have commented on the JS script what each section does.

Lastly I used CSS to alter how the page looks, from the colour palette to where the buttons are placed.
